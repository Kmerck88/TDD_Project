# Test Driven Development (TDD) Practice - README

## Objective
This repository is dedicated to practicing and studying Test Driven Development (TDD). The goal is to improve my coding skills by following TDD principles.

## Daily Practice Template

### Date: [01/24/24]

#### Objective:
Today, I aimed to enhance my comfort with Xunit testing by successfully writing simple tests.

#### Steps:
1. **Write a Failing Test:**
   - Identify a small, specific functionality to implement.
   - Create a test case that captures the expected behavior.
   - Ensure the test fails initially.

2. **Write the Minimum Code:**
   - Implement the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
   - Resist the temptation to add extra features at this stage.

3. **Refactor Code:**
   - Review the code for improvements.
   - Optimize and refactor the code without changing its behavior.
   - Ensure the tests still pass after refactoring.

4. **Repeat:**
   - Iterate through steps 1-3 for the next functionality.
   - Keep cycles short and focused.
